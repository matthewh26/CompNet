# CompNet

Application to recommend your champ selection based on yours + enemies' team comp

Data Used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/luisfmcuriel/league-of-legends-team-compositions-dataset
(currently)


**TO DO:**

-Use data from Riot API (high elo games so less noise due to non-comp related factors)

-Change model to be role specific (?) 

-Optimize model 

-Add feature that combines the score from the model with the player's champ proficiency/ add individual champ pool specificity

-Create web application (get Riot approval)
